<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/catbaz.jpg" -->
### Assumptions
#### Open Source is Good and Strategic
---
* Improve CapTech brand
* Improve CapTech creds
* Enhance individuals' brands
* Open up prospective technology spaces/clients/relationships
 * [Capital One](https://github.com/capitalone), [Wells Fargo](https://github.com/WellsFargoFullStackTDD-Charlotte), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Heroku](https://github.com/heroku), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [AWS](https://github.com/alexa)
* Get ahead of competitors
 * [Deloitte](https://github.com/Deloitte-VA), [Accenture](https://github.com/Accenture), [Singlestone](https://github.com/singlestone)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/catbaz.jpg" -->
#### OpenSource = Good
---
* CapTech Open Source products:
 * Original projects
 * Reference for blogging/articles/presentations
 * Reference for training/tech challenges
* CapTech has been active in contributing and leveraging open source since the beginning:
 * Python - 1999, Sleepycat - 2000, [BS4J - 2002](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bs4j/files/bs4j/)
* GitHub is the [current] place for Open Source
* Oh, reality is that the train has left the station...

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/elephant.jpg" -->
### Current State
#### People Lacking Unification
---
* Many Employees (especially Engineers) already have personal GitHub accounts
* Some Service Offerings have GitHub orgs
* GitLab is internal/private
* Several "CapTech" GitHub orgs exist
* Sporadic references to CapTech from personal and project GitHub accounts
* We don't really know existing open source [GitHub] contributions  


---


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/mysql.jpg" -->
### To-Be
#### Long-Term Normative Scenario
---
* Encourage personal GitHub accounts
* Use the single CapTechConsulting GitHub Org
* Personal/Project and Company contributions are known and tracked
 * Individual GitHub users [employees] shall reference CapTech


---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Apache.jpg" -->
### Next Steps
#### So, by end of year
---
* Build out GitHub org with Legal and Marketing
coordinated description for an approved project:
 * Alfred (Apache 2.0 or MIT License)
* Sketch a policy with specific guidance on GitLab vs. GitHub
* Continue conversations with the active individuals to start converging activities
* Initial Company-wide Open Source comm.
 

--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Apache.jpg" -->
### Next Steps
#### End of year communication
---
* Announce CapTech Open Source Strategy/Policy coming in 2018
* In the interim:
 * Your existing GitHub is your account.
 * GitHub is a form of social media and thus social media policy applies.
 * GitHub is not a replacement for GitLab. Official business should
never leave CapTech servers, workstations, or assets.
* Announce Alfred

--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Apache.jpg" -->
### At this point
#### TO BE CLEAR
---
* NOT providing a new mechanism to leak assets.
* NOT endorsing the work CapTechers are doing outside of CapTech.
* NOT incubating projects.
* ARE Providing Marketing/Legal coordination to open source Alfred.
* ARE Relieving anxiety around our lack of an Open Source presence.

### Additional Benefits to going Open on GitHub


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### An Open Source Presence
#### Aligns with strategic objectives across the organization
---
* Practice Areas
 * One stop shopping for knowledge sharing in a standards-based, industry best practices way
 * Provides integrations with all the right tools (CI/CD, DevOps)


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### An Open Source Presence
#### Aligns with strategic objectives across the organization
---
* Business Dev. and Marketing
 * Project Incubation for brand awareness
 * Sharing project to project when innovating reusable components
 * GitHub is defacto place for developers to congregate and validate street cred (license to code)


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### An Open Source Presence
#### Aligns with strategic objectives across the organization
---
* Recruiting and PR
 * Improve tech screen rates (validation)
 * "Check out our GitHub org"
 * Showcase internal innovations (like NLP)
 * Showcase community outreach
 * Retention mechanism
 * Gamification (Already work on an Alexa skill - forks and stars)


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### More Visible Community Contributions
#### Use the Source, Luke
---
* Readme's with ties into build
 * https://github.com/wray/alexa_python
* Learning projects
 * slackbot
 * alexa
 * maker (e.g. rPi sensors, model rockets, etc.)


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### More Visible Community Contributions
---
* Turn Projects into ongoing events
* Vice Versa
* Meetups (Easy Wins)
* Also raise vendor awareness
 * Companies like Amazon are "looking" in places like GitHub and medium for thought leaders
 * They Appreciate Community Involvement just as much as locals
 * swag


--


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/Octocat-back.jpg" -->
### Better Company-Wide Situational Awareness
#### Choose to ride the wave or get left behind
---
* At Cap1, we learn to search in GitHub when trying to find who to ask for help in slack.
* Latest GitHub API is GraphQL!
* Today it is more about what you do/have done in code and less about your talk.
* The Cloud levels the field. No excuses for not "leveraging open source in the cloud using big data to make real-time decisions" - Rich Fairbank


---


<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff2222" -->
### The end
#### Questions / Comments?
---
* Ask for access to repo to contribute or add issues/comments.
